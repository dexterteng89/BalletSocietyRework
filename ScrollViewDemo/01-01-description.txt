Balanchine’s Apollon Musagete (Apollo leader of the Muses) shows the newly born god immediately becoming a man in late adolescence, and he promptly starts teaching three of his nine Muses the skills by which each is known. The idea for the ballet goes back to at least 5th century Greece, as in this drinking cup where the young god teaches a Muse whose special skill is, like his, playing the lyre and singing words as she plays. This Muse is probably Cleio, the muse of epics like the Iliad. Note the strange combination, to us, of Apollo’s nudity and his robe. As a god of the perfection of human form, he is most often depicted nude. Recent studies have shown that the abdomen or ‘six-pack’ of Greek male gods is depicted as something larger and more developed than any human achieves. So he may also be displaying his divine six-pack.
